/*
Given an integer N, the task is to group numbers such that each group is mutually co-prime together with the total grouping is minimum.
Approach: The key observation in this problem is two consecutive numbers are always co-prime. That is GCD(a, a+1) = 1. 
Another important observation is even numbers canâ€™t be listed in one group. Because they will lead to the greatest common divisor of 2. 
Therefore, every consecutive even and odd numbers can be grouped into one group and 1 can be in any group because the greatest common 
divisor of numbers with 1 is always 1.

function mutuallyCoprime(n){
  if (n <= 3){
    // Loop for the numbers less than the 4
    for (let j = 1; j < n + 1; j++)
      console.log(j + " "); 
  } else { 
    // Integers 1, 2 and 3 can be grouped into one group 
    console.log("1 2 3"); 
    for (let j = 4; j < n; j += 2){ 
      // Consecutive even and odd numbers 
      console.log(j + " " + (j + 1));
