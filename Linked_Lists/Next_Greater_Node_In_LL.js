/*
 Each node may have a next larger value: for node_i, next_larger(node_i) is the 
 node_j.val such that j > i, node_j.val > node_i.val, and j is the smallest 
 possible choice.  If such a j does not exist, the next larger value is 0.
 Return an array of integers answer, where answer[i] = next_larger(node_{i+1}).

 Note that in the example inputs (not outputs) below, arrays such as [2,1,5] 
 represent the serialization of a linked list with a head node value of 2, second 
 node value of 1, and third node value of 5.
